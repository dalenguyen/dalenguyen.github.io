                <p>I have done researching and creating my first IT blog since 2012 then starting to design websites and web applications, and I am passionate about the web development career.</p>
                <p>I am a full stack developer. I take projects from the initial concept stage through to completion. I stay on top of leading front and back end technologies such as <strong>Angular, NodeJS, Firebase, SQL/NoSQL, LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP), HTML 5 and CSS 3, Docker, Resful API</strong> to ensure the optimum code peformance and site security for my clients.</p>
                <p>My favourite work environments are <strong>Angular, NodeJS and Firebase</strong>. They are outstanding digital technologies because of pre-build flexibility, ease-of-use structure code that allows you to spend more time on creating an actual website instead of spending time on repetitive code.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I love to travel as much as possible.</p>
