Contributing
------------

In general, I follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that I can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
